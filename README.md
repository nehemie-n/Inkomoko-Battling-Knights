# **Battling Knights**

## **Running Codes**

To run and test the codes/game codes you will need to have python installed. If you also are familiar with Makefiles that will help.

The command for running the codes and seeing the output is is

`python -m project.src.main`
<br> Or just
<br>
`make run` if you are familira with Makefiles

<br>

## **Testing**

The command for running unit tests is

`python -m unittest discover -s tests -t project`
<br>
or just <br>
`make run_tests`

## **Approach**

* Aproacched the problem using OOP, however, some segments still need refactoring 
* Some functinoalities need to go in direct consuming classes rather than grand parent
